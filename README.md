# Capstone-Project-2

## Prediction of board game rates based on their reviews 

Board games have regained popularity in recent years, they make it possible to entertain many afternoons with family or evenings with friends during hours. 

### The purpose of this project is first, to built a dataframe using scraping and APIs on the website: https://boardgamegeek.com and then to construct a model using machine learning and natural language processing to predict the rating of board games based on the reviews of clients and some other features as the number of players, the average time of a game, the number of rates.

- The file "Capstone Project 2 Final Report.pdf" reports the whole process including the problem statement, the data collection, a wrangling summary, an exploratory data analysis summary with visualization and inferential statistics & the results of the final analysis using machine learning and natural language processing. 

- The file "Capstone Project 2.ipynb" gathers all the code.

- The file "Capstone Project 2 Dataset.ipynb" is the code used to build the dataset using scraping and APIs on the website: https://boardgamegeek.com

- The file "Capstone Project 2_Presentation is a presentation of the project spread over a few slides.
